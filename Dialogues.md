Here is the list of dialogues present in Pizza Time

## Intro
### Pizza Order

- [OPERATOR] Pizza Pasta, how can I help?
- [CLIENT] Hey there, I wanted some pizza for a small party I'm giving. I was thinking around 100. How fast can you make them?
- [OPERATOR] Uh that's a lot of pizza. Let me check. \*Hold music starts*
- [OPERATOR] \*Hold music stops* I think we can make them in around an hour, is that ok?
- [CLIENT] Sounds good, thanks. The place is 405 Lexington Ave, the big building, you can't miss it. Name's Jimmy Patrinki.
- [OPERATOR] Pff- of course. Thanks for the order, bye!

### At the building

**Voice coming out of an intercom, slighly distorted, and party sounds in the background** <br>
- \*bzzz* Heyo, pizza's hereeeee! I'm on the last floor, can you bring it up? Oh I almost forgot, elevator's broken, you'll need to do it the old way!

## NPCs

### Couch Dude

**Chill guy, totally bored not finding anything to watch on the TV**<br>
- Hey there, the pizza guy I reckon. 
    - Oh no that's not for me, it's for my brother. He lives on the last floor.
    - I'm sure he told you already, but the elevator's broken. I believe the only way up is through the puzzles.
- Do you know of any good shows to watch? I can't find anything here.
- Wanna play some chess?
    - Mh maybe it's not the time, you seem busy.
- What kind of place is this, you ask? That's actually a good question.
    - Maybe there's a documentary about it.

### Labyrinth 

**A bit slow, literally has no clue where he is**<br>
- Mmmmm... Mmmmmm... I think I'm kinda lost. This place feels like a labyrinth.
    - Is that pizza? Can I have some? I don't remember how long I've been stuck here.
    - Anyways, I've been trying to go around these halls but I always end up here. I think I'll just wait around, I don't have much to do anyways.
- I saw a round platform that goes down earlier, it seemed a bit different from the others. I wonder if there's something special about it.
- Do you have a couple bucks for the bus ticket?
- Oh! I was delivering pizza in this place! I keep forgetting that for some reason.

### Meditation Sphere 

**Gabbro lives inside him**<br>
- Oh hey there, I almost didn't notice you. You move very silently.
    - It's peaceful up here, don't you think? Being under this giant metal sphere makes me think about death in a very welcoming way. 
    - It's just bound to happen, y'know. Sometimes it's hard to accept it, and a lot of times it frightens me. I think it's best to just look at it for what it is..destiny.
- The pizza is round, like the sphere. The sphere is round, like the world.
    - Pizza is all.
- You wanna stay here and meditate together?
    - If you ever feel stuck or frustrated there's always a place for you here, my friend.
- Two roads from here. I think they both lead to something useful, in their own way.

### Elevators 

**HYPE MAN**<br>
- Yoooo yoooo what is up duuude
    - Are you here for the party? I think I got drunk and fell from those platforms up there, but hey at least I took with me these sick beats!
- You wondering how to get up there? Have you tried jumping when the platforms move up? Momentum is key babeyyyyy!
