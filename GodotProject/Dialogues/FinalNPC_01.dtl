Hahahaha you should see the look on your face!
Hey, I hope you're not mad at me. I just wanted to have some fun. You know, everybody is always so serious, talking about problems they need to have just to be able to fight against something.
I think everybody should just chill down and enjoy the ride a little bit more, y' know what I mean?
...
How about you? Why don't you stay up here a while and enjoy the view with some nice pizza?
I bet it'll be worth your while.
