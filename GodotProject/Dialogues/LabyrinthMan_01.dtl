I think I'm kinda lost. This place feels like a labyrinth.
Is that pizza? Can I have some? I don't remember how long I've been stuck here.
Anyways, I've been trying to go around these halls but I always end up here. I think I'll just rest a while.\

The view is quite something from this height.
Anyways, the people upstairs would probably like to have some pizza too! Maybe you can bring them some, if you find the way up.
