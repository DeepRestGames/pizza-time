Oh hey there, I almost didn't notice you. You move very silently.
It's peaceful up here, don't you think? Being under this giant metal sphere makes me think about death in a very welcoming way.
It's just bound to happen, y'know. Sometimes it's hard to accept it, and a lot of times it frightens me. I think it's best to just look at it for what it is..destiny.
